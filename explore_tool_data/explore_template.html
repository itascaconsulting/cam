          <p>
            This software program is provided by Itasca Consulting Group, Inc.
            ("Itasca") or one of its authorized suppliers. Title to the media on
            which the software is recorded and to the documentation in support
            thereof is transferred to the customer, but title to the software is
            retained by Itasca. Itasca and its licensors own all intellectual
            property in the software. Itasca permits you to use the software
            only in accordance with the terms of this agreement. You assume
            responsibility for the selection of the software to achieve your
            intended results and for the installation of the software, the use
            of and the results obtained from the software.
          </p>
          <p><strong>LICENSE</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              All Itasca software (with the exception of Demonstration Versions,
              see below) are secured and require a hardware lock to cycle.
            </li>
            <li>
              A standard single license allows up to two instances of the
              software to cycle on a single computer. A Network Version (see
              below) allows one instance of the software, per seat, to cycle on
              any computer connected to the network.
            </li>
            <li>
              You may not use, copy, modify, or transfer the software, or any
              copy, in whole or part, except as expressly provided in this
              document. You may not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble
              the software to obtain the source code of the software.
            </li>
            <li>
              You may not sell, sub-license, rent, or lease this software.
            </li>
            <li>
              Licenses are not transferable outside the purchasing organization,
              company, institution, or corporation. Licenses sold to private
              individuals are not transferable under any terms.
            </li>
            <li>
              The software may not be shared, installed, or used concurrently on
              different computers (with the exception of Network Versions, see
              below).
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p><strong>TERMS</strong></p>
          <p>
            The license is effective as indicated under the purchasing terms or
            until terminated. You may terminate it any time by destroying the
            software together with any back-up copies and returning the hardware
            lock. It will also terminate if you fail to comply with any term or
            condition of this agreement. You agree upon such termination to
            destroy the software together with any back-up copies,
            modifications, and/or merged portions in any form and return the
            hardware lock to Itasca.
          </p>
          <p><strong>WARRANTY</strong></p>
          <p>
            Itasca will correct any errors in the software at no charge for
            twelve (12) months after the purchase date of the software.
            Notification of a suspected error must be made in writing, with a
            complete listing of the input and output files and description of
            the error. If, in the judgment of Itasca, the software does contain
            an error, Itasca will (at its option) correct or replace the copy at
            no cost to the user or refund the initial purchase price of the
            software. This warranty does not apply to demonstration versions
            (see below).
          </p>
          <p><strong>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</strong></p>
          <p>
            Itasca assumes no liability whatsoever with respect to any use of
            the software or any portion thereof or with respect to any damages
            or losses that may result from such use, including (without
            limitation) loss of time, money or goodwill that may arise from the
            use of the software (including any modifications or updates that may
            follow). In no event shall Itasca be responsible for any indirect,
            special, incidental or consequential damages arising from use of the
            software.
          </p>
          <p><strong>EXPORT</strong></p>
          <p>
            You may not ship, transfer, or export into any country the software
            or its updates in any manner prohibited by the United States Export
            Administration Act or any other export laws or restrictions. In
            addition, you represent and warrant that you are not a citizen of,
            or located within, an embargoed nation and that you are not
            otherwise prohibited under United States Export Laws to receive the
            software. Rights to use the software are forfeited for failure to
            comply with this agreement.
          </p>
          <p><strong>HARDWARE LOCKS</strong></p>
          <p>
            Title to the hardware lock(s) associated with a license belongs to
            Itasca. You are wholly responsible to maintain and safeguard the
            hardware lock. Itasca reserves the right to determine the cost of
            replacing a lost or stolen hardware lock, up to and including the
            cost of a new license.
          </p>
          <p><strong>UPDATES AND UPGRADES</strong></p>
          <p>
            If the software is an update or an upgrade to a previous version,
            you must possess a valid license to the previous version. Any update
            or upgrade provided for a previous version is subject to the terms
            of this agreement. You may continue to use previous versions
            provided that (a) it is necessary to use the previous version to
            read or otherwise use outputs from that version of the program, (b)
            you do not transfer the previous version to another party, and (c)
            you acknowledge that any obligation that Itasca has to support the
            previous version of the program may end upon obtaining the update or
            upgrade.
          </p>
          <p><strong>NETWORK VERSIONS</strong></p>
          <p>
            If and only if the license is a network version, the terms of this
            agreement apply in all respects with the following exception: the
            software may be used concurrently on the number of machines for
            which the program has been licensed and as allowable by the
            program's hardware lock.
          </p>
          <p><strong>DEMONSTRATION VERSIONS</strong></p>
          <p>
            If and only if the software is used in demonstration mode, the terms
            of this agreement apply in all respects with the following
            exceptions. The software is provided "AS-IS" and Itasca bears no
            responsibility to provide support for the software. The software
            shall be operable without a hardware lock. You acknowledge that the
            software may contain bugs, errors or other problems for which Itasca
            disclaims any warranty or liability obligations.
          </p>
          <p><strong>ANNUAL MAINTENANCE</strong></p>
          <p>
            Some Itasca software are licensed under an Annual Maintenance Plan.
            The Annual Maintenance Plan includes support (as defined below under
            Software Support), service updates and full-version upgrades. Such
            support, updates and upgrades are only available while enrolled in
            the Maintenance Plan.
          </p>
          <p><strong>SOFTWARE SUPPORT</strong></p>
          <p>
            For software products that are not licensed under an Annual
            Maintenance Plan, Itasca will provide support for the current
            release version as well as for the version immediately preceding the
            current version for 12 months after release of the current version.
          </p>
          <p>
            Software support includes providing email and telephone support, at
            no charge, to assist the software owner in the installation of the
            software on the owner's computer system. Additionally, general
            assistance may be provided in aiding the owner in understanding the
            capabilities of the various features of the software. However,
            no-cost assistance is not provided for help in applying Itasca
            Software to specific user-defined problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            Technical support covering modeling questions, applications,
            definitions, interpretation of results, design guidelines, etc., can
            be provided through the Premium Service Plan (for PFC users) or
            purchased on an as-needed basis. For users who envisage the need for
            substantial amounts of assistance, consulting support is available.
            In all instances, the user is encouraged to send the problem
            description to Itasca by fax or electronic mail in order to minimize
            the amount of time spent trying to define the problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            Itasca reserves the right to determine what qualifies as no-cost
            assistance and what requires payment.
          </p>
